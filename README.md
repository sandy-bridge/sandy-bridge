### Hello.

This is where I intend to (eventually) store my portfolio.

### Coding

I'm experienced in C# and C++ to an intermediate level and have completed various personal and university projects in Java, Python, PHP and Javascript.

### Serving

I maintain a homelab server running a few Docker containers, right now it's only a Jellyfin media server and a Wordpress web server behind Nginx. Have previously hosted a TeamSpeak and various game servers. I've also done a large university project with Ansible, automating the deployment of a dockerized application as well as a database, DNS, Nginx, Prometheus and Grafana to support it.
