### Hello.

This is where I intend to (eventually) store my portfolio.

### Background

Since my teenage years I have been learning about computers, servers and IT infrastructure in my free time. I launched my first home server in 2015 running Windows Server, although I wised up a few years later and moved to Linux on Azure. My high-school was IT oriented and my thesis involved the setup of Active Directory with basic Group Policy. I earned a bachelor's degree at the Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) in Cyber Security Engineering. My final thesis in university was a documented proposal for a backup system using Duplicity over OpenVPN. I'm currently a conscript in the Estonian Defence Forces in Cyber Command, and my tasks mainly involve improvement of build & deploy automation processes using Puppet, Docker, Podman and Nexus.

### Coding

I'm experienced in C# and C++ to an intermediate level and have completed various personal and university projects in Java, Python, PHP and Javascript.

### Serving

I maintain a homelab server running a few Docker containers, right now it's only a Jellyfin media server and a Wordpress web server behind Nginx. Have previously hosted a TeamSpeak and various game servers. I've also done a large university project with Ansible, automating the deployment of a dockerized application as well as a database, DNS, Nginx, Prometheus and Grafana to support it.
